TASK MANAGEMENT INTERFACE - IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
----------------
This is a production-ready task management interface built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, 
featuring both Kanban board and list view layouts with full responsive design.

LAYOUT DECISIONS
----------------

1. Component Architecture:
   - Separated concerns into logical folders: /components, /pages, /data, /lib
   - Created reusable components (Avatar, Badge, StatusBadge, Container) for consistency
   - Implemented icon library for centralized SVG management
   - Used composition pattern for complex components (TaskDrawer, TopBar)

2. Spacing & Typography System:
   - Consistent spacing scale using Tailwind utilities (p-2, p-3, p-4, gap-2, gap-3, gap-4)
   - Typography hierarchy: text-xs (labels), text-sm (body), text-lg (headings)
   - Maintained 4px base unit for all spacing decisions
   - Used consistent border-radius (rounded-md, rounded-lg) throughout

3. Color Palette:
   - Gray scale for neutral elements (gray-50 to gray-900)
   - Blue for primary actions (blue-500, blue-600)
   - Status colors: gray (backlog), blue (in-progress), yellow (review), green (done)
   - Priority colors: gray (low), blue (medium), orange (high), red (urgent)

4. Visual Hierarchy:
   - Cards use subtle shadows (shadow-sm) with hover states (shadow-md)
   - Borders for separation (border-gray-200)
   - Consistent padding inside cards (p-3, p-4)
   - Clear visual grouping with borders and spacing

RESPONSIVENESS APPROACH
-----------------------

1. Mobile-First Strategy (375-414px):
   - Kanban columns: Horizontal scroll with flex layout
   - Task drawer: Full-width overlay with slide-in animation
   - List view: Card-style stacked layout with all info visible
   - TopBar: Compact layout with icon-only buttons, smaller text
   - Search bar: Reduced width, expandable on focus

2. Tablet (768px - 1279px):
   - Kanban: 2-3 columns visible, smooth horizontal scroll
   - List view: Maintains card style with better spacing
   - TopBar: Shows some text labels alongside icons

3. Desktop (≥1280px):
   - Kanban: All 4 columns visible side-by-side
   - Task drawer: Fixed 384px width (w-96) on the right
   - List view: Full table layout with grid system (grid-cols-12)
   - TopBar: Full labels and optimal spacing

4. Breakpoint Strategy:
   - sm: 640px (small adjustments)
   - md: 768px (show more text)
   - lg: 1024px (switch to desktop layouts)
   - Used Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) consistently

WIREFRAME → REACT MAPPING
--------------------------

1. Kanban Board:
   Wireframe Element → React Component
   - Top bar → TopBar.jsx (with Container wrapper)
   - Board title → h1 in TopBar
   - Project selector → <select> in TopBar
   - Search bar → Input with SearchIcon in TopBar
   - Filter button → Button with FilterIcon in TopBar
   - New Task button → Button with PlusIcon in TopBar
   - Kanban columns → KanbanColumn.jsx (mapped from columns array)
   - Task cards → TaskCard.jsx (mapped from mockTasks data)
   - Drag handle → SVG icon with hover opacity effect

2. Task Details Drawer:
   Wireframe Element → React Component
   - Drawer container → TaskDrawer.jsx with slide animation
   - Title field → Input with label
   - Status dropdown → Select with options
   - Priority dropdown → Select with options
   - Assignee selector → Select with dynamic options from mockData
   - Due date field → Date input
   - Description area → Textarea
   - Comments section → Mapped from task.commentsList array
   - Activity log → Mapped from task.activityLog array
   - Action buttons → Cancel and Save buttons

3. List View:
   Wireframe Element → React Component
   - Toolbar → Same TopBar component (reused)
   - Table header → Grid layout with column labels (hidden on mobile)
   - Task rows → TaskRow.jsx with dual layout (mobile card / desktop grid)
   - Status column → StatusBadge component
   - Priority column → Badge component
   - Assignee column → Avatar + name
   - Actions menu → Three-dot button (placeholder)

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
---------------------------------

1. State Management:
   - Local state with useState for drawer open/close
   - Search functionality with useMemo for performance
   - Selected task state for drawer content

2. Routing:
   - React Router DOM for navigation between Kanban and List views
   - Clean URLs: /kanban and /list
   - Navigate component for default redirect

3. Data Structure:
   - Mock data in separate file (mockData.js)
   - Each task includes: id, title, status, priority, assignee, dueDate, comments, 
     attachments, description, commentsList, activityLog
   - Bengali language content for realistic local context

4. Performance Optimizations:
   - useMemo for filtered tasks (search functionality)
   - Component-level code splitting ready
   - Minimal re-renders with proper state management
   - Efficient CSS with Tailwind's purge in production

5. Accessibility Considerations:
   - Semantic HTML elements (header, button, select, input)
   - Proper labels for form fields
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Focus states on interactive elements
   - ARIA-friendly structure

6. Code Organization:
   /src
     /components
       /common       - Reusable UI components
       /drawer       - Task drawer component
       /kanban       - Kanban-specific components
       /list         - List view components
       /Icons        - SVG icon library
     /pages          - Route-level components
     /data           - Mock data
     /lib            - Utility functions (cn for className merging)

DESIGN PATTERNS USED
--------------------

1. Composition: Components built from smaller reusable pieces
2. Container/Presentational: Separation of logic and UI
3. Render Props: Flexible component APIs
4. Controlled Components: Form inputs managed by React state
5. Single Responsibility: Each component has one clear purpose

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Not Required)
-----------------------------------

1. Drag-and-drop functionality with react-beautiful-dnd or dnd-kit
2. Real API integration
3. Task creation/editing with form validation
4. Filtering by status, priority, assignee
5. Sorting options
6. Dark mode support
7. Keyboard shortcuts
8. Task dependencies visualization
9. Time tracking
10. File attachments upload

BROWSER COMPATIBILITY
---------------------
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- ES6+ JavaScript features used
- Tailwind CSS v3.4+ compatible

DEPLOYMENT NOTES
----------------
- Build command: npm run build
- Output directory: dist/
- Optimized for static hosting (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- Environment variables: None required (static mock data)
- No backend dependencies
